        <p>Consider hiding the status bar --and all other app UI--while people are actively viewing
            full-screen media. If you hide the status bar, be sure to let people retrieve it 
            (and the appropriate app UI) with a single tap. Unless you have a conmpelling reason to
            do so, avoid defining a custom gesture to redisplay the status bar becuase users are unlikely
            to discover such a gesture or remember it.
